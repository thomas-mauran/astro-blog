# Hi there, welcome on this blog üõ∞Ô∏è 

My name is Thomas, I'm a 22 years old student in computer science. I'm passionate about space physics and astrophotography. I started this blog to share my journey about basically everything which is not related to computer science. I hope you will enjoy reading my articles and watching my pictures.
