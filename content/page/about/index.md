# Hi there, welcome on this blog üõ∞Ô∏è 

My name is Thomas, I'm a 22 years old student in computer science. I'm passionate about space physics and astrophotography. I started this blog to share my journey in astrophotography and science in general, basically everything I do which is not related to computer science.
