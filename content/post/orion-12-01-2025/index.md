This is my first time trying the new widefield setup ! I only managed to get 1 hour of Orion and 1h 30 on the rosette nebula, here is the result.

Even though I have a lot of noise due to an almost full moon not a lot of data I am very amazed by the result. I will make another post to present the widefield setup but basically I mounted a nikon lense on the zwo camera and am guiding using a smaller guidescope. This new setup will allow me to capture huge objects which are too big for the quattro 150p !
