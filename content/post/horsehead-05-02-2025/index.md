# Information

The horsehead nebula, Barnard 33, is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. The nebula is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by Scottish astronomer Williamina Fleming on photographic plate B2312 taken at the Harvard College Observatory.

## Comments

For 2 hours, this is a great shot ! We have a good view of the horsehead shape and the flame nebula is also very visible. The colors are very vibrant, the noise could really be improved with more data though.
