# Informations

The Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31, is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and is about 2.5 million light-years away. The Andromeda galaxy is the largest galaxy in the Local Group, which also includes the Milky Way, the Triangulum galaxy, and about 54 other smaller galaxies.

The Andromeda galaxy is a massive galaxy, with a diameter of about 220,000 light-years, making it about 2.5 times larger than the Milky Way. It contains about 1 trillion stars, compared to the Milky Way's 200-400 billion stars. The Andromeda galaxy is also moving towards the Milky Way at a speed of about 110 km/s and is expected to collide with our galaxy in about 4 billion years.

## Comment

Overall I am so happy with how the shot turned out, considering I used the DSLR instead of the good old quattro and ZWO setup. Living in a bortle 7 zone makes shooting broadband targets very difficult. I had a hard time processing that data but in the end the result is very satisfying, even tough I have a little bit of noise in the background which can be improved in the future.
