# Informations

To get more information about the Dumbell Nebula, you can check the [previous post](/p/dumbell-nebula-m27-06-09-2024/).

This is my second attempt at the Dumbbell Nebula, I wanted to try to get a better picture of it and the result turned out great. Overall I managed to get way more data and learn a lot of new processing techniques. 

Here is a side to side comparison of the two pictures:
