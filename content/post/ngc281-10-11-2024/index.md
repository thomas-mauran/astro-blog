# Informations

NGC 281, also known as the Pacman Nebula, is a bright emission nebula located in the constellation Cassiopeia. The nebula is about 9,500 light-years away from Earth and is part of the Perseus spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. The Pacman Nebula gets its name from its resemblance to the video game character Pacman, with a large central void surrounded by a bright, circular rim.

The Pacman Nebula is a region of active star formation, with young, hot stars ionizing the surrounding gas and dust, causing it to glow brightly.

I will try to upload another version with a different color palette soon.
