# Information

The Heart Nebula, IC 1805, Sh2-190, lies some 7500 light years away from Earth and is located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. This is an emission nebula showing glowing gas and darker dust lanes. The nebula is formed by plasma of ionized hydrogen and free electrons.

## Comments

Second shot with the new widefield setup and it turned out better than expected ! I managed to get 7h30 of exposure on the heart nebula and the result is very satisfying and allowed me to reduce a lot the noise in the picture. The features of the nebulas are so sharp and the color is so vibrant.
