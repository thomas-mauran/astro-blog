# Informations

NGC 6820 is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Vulpecula, about 6,000 light-years away from Earth. It surrounds the open star cluster NGC 6823, and the two objects are closely associated. The nebula is a region of active star formation, and it is often studied for its striking features, including dark pillars of gas and dust that resemble those found in the famous "Pillars of Creation" within the Eagle Nebula.

NGC 6820 is illuminated by the bright young stars within the cluster, which are responsible for carving out cavities in the surrounding gas through strong stellar winds and radiation. These processes shape the pillars and create bright rims, making it a visually striking object for astrophotographers.

The nebula spans approximately 50 light-years and contains a mix of gas and dust that contributes to its vibrant colors in astrophotography. The reddish hues typically come from hydrogen gas, while blue areas are due to reflected starlight. Observing and imaging NGC 6820 can be challenging due to its relatively faint magnitude, requiring long exposure times to reveal its intricate details.

This nebula is a beautiful example of the complex interactions between young stars and the clouds of gas from which they are born.

I tried playing with the color palette by spliting Ha and OIII channels and mixing them back together. I don't think I managed to get a perfectly accurate color representation since it looks more yellow than anything but I still like the result.
