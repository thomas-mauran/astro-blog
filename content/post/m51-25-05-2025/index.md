# Informations

M51 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781. M51 is at a distance of about 25 million light-years away from Earth.

Those shots were taken on 2 nights, the first one is 20s x 715 and the second one is roughly 20s x 1850.

Somehow the first shot looks better than the second one, I'm not sure why, my process was not good enough for the second one.
