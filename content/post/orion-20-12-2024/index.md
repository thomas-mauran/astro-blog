# Informations

The Orion Nebula, also known as Messier 42, is a diffuse nebula located in the constellation Orion. The nebula is about 24 light-years across and is located about 1,344 light-years away from Earth. The Orion Nebula is one of the brightest and most well-known nebulae in the night sky and is visible to the naked eye as a fuzzy patch of light in the constellation Orion.

## Comments

After shooting jupiter Orion was in a good position so I decided to take a quick shot of it. I didn't use any filters and I didn't guide the mount. I just pointed the scope to Orion and took 25 minutes of exposure. With that little amount of data and the lack of guiding the result is very satisfying.

For comparaison here is a picture of Orion taken 8 months before with 50 minutes of exposure and the old setup

Obviously the new setup is much better and getting a lot more light for half the exposure time. I will redo orion with a lot more exposure time and guiding in the future to get a better picture without blur.
