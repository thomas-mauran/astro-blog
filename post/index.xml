&lt;p>Somehow the first shot looks better than the second one, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, my process was not good enough for the second one.&lt;/p>

M106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million light-years away from Earth. It is also a Seyfert II galaxy, which means that due to x-rays and unusual emission lines detected, it is suspected that part of the galaxy is falling into a supermassive black hole in the center.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="new-gear">New gear
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I recently acquired a simple new gear to take widefield exposure, as my dad is a great fan of photography we always have had a lot of photo lenses at home, I already tried to take some widefield shots with them such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/andromeda-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Andromeda&lt;/a> galaxy but the setup was kind of complicated and not relyable with N.I.N.A. for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found online that you could plug ZWO cameras directly to Nikon lenses using a simple adapter. I already had a Nikon 70-200 f2.8 lens at home so I decided to give it a try. Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect fit working very well !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also bought a small guiding scope, the SVBONY SV165, which is very cheap but does the job very well. I mounted it on my ZWO ASI 120mm mini monochrome camera and it&amp;rsquo;s working very well !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even though I have a lot of noise due to an almost full moon not a lot of data I am very amazed by the result. I will make another post to present the widefield setup but basically I mounted a nikon lense on the zwo camera and am guiding using a smaller guidescope. This new setup will allow me to capture huge objects which are too big for the quattro 150p !&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After shooting jupiter Orion was in a good position so I decided to take a quick shot of it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use any filters and I didn&amp;rsquo;t guide the mount. I just pointed the scope to Orion and took 25 minutes of exposure. With that little amount of data and the lack of guiding the result is very satisfying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For comparaison here is a picture of Orion taken 8 months before with 50 minutes of exposure and the old setup&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Obviously the new setup is much better and getting a lot more light for half the exposure time. I will redo orion with a lot more exposure time and guiding in the future to get a better picture without blur.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>M33 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Triangulum. It is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy. The galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and about 54 other smaller galaxies. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye. The Triangulum Galaxy is located approximately 3 million light-years from Earth and has a diameter of about 60,000 light-years. It is composed of about 40 billion stars. This faint blue color is due to the presence of many young, hot stars in the galaxy. The galaxy is also home to many star-forming regions, which are areas where new stars are being born. The Triangulum Galaxy is a popular target for amateur astronomers because of its relative proximity to Earth and its large size.

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>NGC 6820 is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Vulpecula, about 6,000 light-years away from Earth. It surrounds the open star cluster NGC 6823, and the two objects are closely associated. The nebula is a region of active star formation, and it is often studied for its striking features, including dark pillars of gas and dust that resemble those found in the famous &amp;ldquo;Pillars of Creation&amp;rdquo; within the Eagle Nebula.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NGC 6820 is illuminated by the bright young stars within the cluster, which are responsible for carving out cavities in the surrounding gas through strong stellar winds and radiation. These processes shape the pillars and create bright rims, making it a visually striking object for astrophotographers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nebula spans approximately 50 light-years and contains a mix of gas and dust that contributes to its vibrant colors in astrophotography. The reddish hues typically come from hydrogen gas, while blue areas are due to reflected starlight. Observing and imaging NGC 6820 can be challenging due to its relatively faint magnitude, requiring long exposure times to reveal its intricate details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This nebula is a beautiful example of the complex interactions between young stars and the clouds of gas from which they are born.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried playing with the color palette by spliting Ha and OIII channels and mixing them back together. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I managed to get a perfectly accurate color representation since it looks more yellow than anything but I still like the result.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The Helix nebula, also known as NGC 7293, is a planetary nebula located in the constellation Aquarius. It is one of the closest planetary nebulae to Earth, lying at a distance of about 700 light-years. This nebula has some very bright colors with a magnitude of 7.3, making it a popular target. The hard part when photographing the Helix is the fasct it reside in a very low part of the sky and doesn&amp;rsquo;t rise very high.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When looking at the center of the Helix nebula, you can see a white dwarf star, which is the remnant of the star that created the nebula. The white dwarf is surrounded by a ring of gas and dust, which is illuminated by the ultraviolet radiation from the star. The nebula is expanding at a rate of about 40 km/s, and it is estimated to be about 2.5 light-years in diameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The color grading we see in the Helix nebula comes from the different elements present in the gas and dust. The red color comes from hydrogen gas, while the blue-green color comes from oxygen gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might be one of my favorite nebulae in the night sky&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The West Veil Nebula, also known as NGC 6960, is part of the larger Veil Nebula complex, which was first discovered by William Herschel in 1784. The Veil Nebula is a massive supernova remnant, and NGC 6960 is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Witch&amp;rsquo;s Broom Nebula&amp;rdquo; due to its broom-like appearance. It is also cataloged as Caldwell 34. This impressive structure lies in the constellation Cygnus and is located about 2,400 light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A supernova remnant is the leftover material from a massive star that exploded in a supernova, scattering its outer layers into space. These remnants are composed of ionized gases and can span several hundred light-years. The Veil Nebula complex is thought to have been created by a supernova that occurred between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the West Veil Nebula, the bright filaments we see come from the shockwaves of the supernova, which are still moving through space, ionizing the surrounding gas. The nebula emits light as these gases are excited by the shockwave&amp;rsquo;s energy. The nebula is rich in ionized hydrogen, which glows red, and ionized oxygen, which produces a blue-green glow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the the West Veil Nebula, it&amp;rsquo;s a stunning example of the aftermath of a stellar explosion.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The Wizard Nebula, also known as NGC 7380, is an open cluster discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1787. William Herschel included his sister&amp;rsquo;s discovery in his catalog, and labelled it H VIII.77. It is also known as 142 in the 1959 Sharpless catalog (Sh2-142). This reasonably large nebula is located in Cepheus. It is considered to be an open cluster with associated nebulosity. It is about 7,200 light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An open cluster is a group of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age. More than half of the known open clusters lie within the disk of the Milky Way galaxy, with the remainder found in its halo and in the spiral arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here the nebula comes from the ionization of the hydrogen gas by the ultraviolet radiation of the young stars in the cluster. The nebula is a region of star formation, which is a common occurrence in the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s called the Wizard Nebula because it looks like a wizard with a hat and a staff. The nebula is a beautiful object to observe and to photograph.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I recently invested in a new telescope and dedicated cooled astro camera. This new setup is a game changer for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-telescope">New telescope
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I live in a bortle 7 zone and my past telescope had a focal ratio of f/8 which is very slow. With a mirror of only 114 mm for a focal length of 900mm. This was not ideal and I had to spend tremendous amount of time to get a decent barely usable picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to switch for the skywatcher quattro 150p which has a focal ratio of f/4. This is a huge upgrade for me. The mirror is 150mm for a focal length of 600mm. This means that I can get a lot more light in the same amount of time. I choose this 150/600 instead of a 150/750 because the quattro was providing a 0.85x coma corrector reducing my focal ratio to f/3.4. Another cool thing is that the quattro is less heavy than the 150/750 which is a good thing for my back and for the guiding system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This scope upgrade makes the new scope 5 times faster than the old one. This means that I can get the same amount of light in 5 times less time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to switch from a newtonian to a refractor because I wanted to take pictures of small objects like galaxies and wanted to have a small focal ratio. The quattro was the perfect choice for me.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I also invested in a new camera. I choose the ZWO ASI 585mc pro. This is a cooled camera with a 2.9um pixel size. This camera is a lot more sensitive than my old camera. The cooling system allows me to take pictures at -15°C which is a huge advantage for long exposure pictures. This new camera is also way easier to manipulate to do the 3 star polar alignment and take picture sessions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I hesitated between the 585mc pro and the 533mc pro which is an older model, the statisitcs looked worse but the field of view of the 533 is wider which is sometimes better. I am very happy with the field of view of the 585mc pro allowing me to shoot narrow objects with a good framing&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-nina-instead-of-ekos">Using N.I.N.A instead of ekos
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I switched from NINA to ekos and now use a regular laptop instead of my raspberry pi which I have to admit is a lot more stable. I use TeamViewer to control the laptop from my phone which is very convenient. I also use the NINA scheduler which is very useful to plan my nights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the next step is to be able to fully automate the session including the meridian flip which I now have to do manually, making me loose time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="filters">Filters
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Since I now have a dedicated astro camera it is way easier for me to use filters now. I invested in a regular UV/IR cut filter for broadband targets and in the SVBony 220 dual narrowband filter for narrowband targets. This filter was naybe one of the biggest chock for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t thought it would make such a big difference but the result is just mind blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a comparison of the same picture with and without the filter:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This new rig is a massive game changer. It is now so much pleasant to take pictures and the results are way better for a minimal amount of time. Overall looking forward to shoot more objects when clear nights will come back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firework galaxy first try - 12-09-2024</title><link>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/firework-galaxy-first-try-12-09-2024/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:20:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/firework-galaxy-first-try-12-09-2024/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/firework-galaxy-first-try-12-09-2024/firework.png" alt="Featured image of post Firework galaxy first try - 12-09-2024" />&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/firework-galaxy-first-try-12-09-2024/firework.png"

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The firework galaxy (NGC 6946) is a face-on intermediate spiral galaxy with a small bright nucleus, with open spiral arms in the constellation Cepheus. It is about 22.5 million light-years away, making it a member of the Local Group of galaxies. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 9, 1798. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 9.6, therefore it is visible with binoculars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is called the firework galaxy because it has had ten supernovae observed in it since 1917, making it one of the most prolific in this respect. The most recent supernova was SN 2017eaw.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The Crescent Nebula (also known as NGC 6888, Caldwell 27, Sharpless 105) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light-years away. It was discovered by Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel in 1792. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward. The inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The outer shell of the Crescent Nebula is about 25 light-years across and is expanding at about 20 km/s. The estimated age of the nebula is about 250,000 years. The star responsible for the nebula is a Wolf-Rayet star, WR 136. The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, ejecting mass at a rate of 10^-5 solar masses per year. The nebula is about 25 arcminutes across, corresponding to a diameter of 18 light-years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This nebula basically is a dying star that is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind. In the end it will explode in a supernova.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as Apple Core Nebula, Messier 27, M 27, or NGC 6853) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula, at a distance of about 1,360 light-years. This object was the first planetary nebula to be discovered; by Charles Messier in 1764. At its brightness of visual magnitude 7.5 and its diameter of about 8 arcminutes, it is easily visible in binoculars, and a popular observing target in amateur telescopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Planetary nebulae represent the final brief stage in the life of a medium-sized star like our Sun. While consuming the last of the fuel in its core, the star expels a large portion of its outer envelope. This material then becomes heated by the radiation from the stellar remnant and radiates, producing glowing clouds of gas that can show complex structures, as the eponymous dumbbell shape of M 27 shows.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When doing astrophotography one main thing to consider is the signal to noise ratio. The more light you can capture the better the image will be. To achieve this, you need to have long exposure times allowing you to reduce the ISO and get a cleaner image with less noise in the end. The problem is that the Earth rotates, and the stars move in the sky. This means that if you want to have long exposure times you need to track the stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My current goto mount allows me to reach up to 30 seconds of exposure time without guiding. This is good for some objects, but for deep sky objects, I need to have longer exposure times to really reduce the noise. To achieve this I need to guide the mount. This means that I need to have a second smaller telescope that will track a star and send corrections to the mount to keep the star in the same position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method is called guiding and is essential for deep sky astrophotography. I recently upgraded rig to include a guide scope but my 114/900 behing quite an uncommon telescope for deepsky imaging I had to overcome some challenges to make it work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-guiding-work-">How does guiding work ?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As said previously guiding is the process of tracking a star and sending corrections to the mount to keep the star in the same position. This is done by taking short exposures of the star and comparing the position of the star in the frame to a reference position. If the star is moving, the guiding software will send corrections to the mount to keep the star in the same position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do so you have multiple options but the most common one is to use a guide scope coupled with a guide camera and a software called PHD2 (Push Here Dummy).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before purshasing anything you need to consider multiple options with both advantages and drawbacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-guidescope-to-choose-">What guidescope to choose ?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A common rule to choose an adapted guide scope is to have a focal length of 1/3 to 1/2 of the main telescope. This is to ensure that the guide scope will have a wider field of view than the main telescope. This is important because the guide scope needs to be able to see enough stars to track one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case my telescope has a focal length of 900mm so I needed a guide scope with a focal length between 300mm and 450mm. I chose a 60/240 guide scope with good reviews, the SVBONY SV106.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="what-guide-camera-to-choose-">What guide camera to choose ?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The main astro camera brand is zwo, their product are used by a lot of astrophotographers and are known for their quality. I chose the ZWO ASI120MM Mini, a monochrome camera with a good sensitivity and a high frame rate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You either can choose a monochrome camera or a color camera. The main difference is that a monochrome camera will be more sensitive and will allow you to take shorter exposures. This is important because the shorter the exposure the less the star will move in the frame and the more accurate the guiding will be. In my case I chose a monochrome camera because I wanted to have the best guiding possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="my-3d-printed-holder">My 3D printed holder
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As mentionned before my telescope is quite uncommon for deep sky imaging. His diameter of 140mm is uncommon meaning I often have to make custom parts to make it work. This time I had to make a custom holder for the guide scope. I managed to find a 3D model for a 8&amp;quot; newtonian telescope and I modified it to fit my telescope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I printed the holder in PLA and glued a small cloth to the inside to avoid scratching the telescope. I ordered a dovetail mount to attach the guide scope to the holder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 3D printed holder turned out perfect but the holes were too small for the screws I found. To avoid printing the whole part again I used a drill to make the holes larger. I only had to screw the holder to the telescope and the guide scope to the holder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After confirming everything was sturdy enough I attached the whole scope and camera to the holder. I then had to adjust the focus of the guide scope to get a sharp image of the stars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="phd2-setup">PHD2 setup
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The last step was to setup PHD2. I had to connect the camera to the raspberry pi and to the mount. When you first start PHD2 you need to make a dark library. This is done by taking multiple dark frames and saving them in a folder. This is used to subtract the noise from the guiding frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can then start to find the focus of the guide scope. This is done by taking short exposures and adjusting the focus until the stars are sharp. This is very important because if the stars are not sharp the guiding will not be accurate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then had to calibrate the camera to make sure the guiding was accurate. This is done by taking short exposures of a star and comparing the position of the star in the frame to a reference position. The software will then send corrections to the mount to keep the star in the same position.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With the new guide scope I can now reach up to 300 seconds of exposure time. This is a huge improvement over the 30 seconds I could reach before. This means that I can now take much cleaner images with less noise (around 200 iso instead of 6400). I am very happy with the results and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to take more images with the new setup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moon - 20-05-2024</title><link>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/moon-20-05-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:20:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/moon-20-05-2024/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/moon-20-05-2024/moon.png" alt="Featured image of post Moon - 20-05-2024" />&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/moon-20-05-2024/moon.png"

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I recently improved my focusing technique by printing a Bahtinov mask. I used a 3D printer to print the mask, and it works great. I can now focus my telescope much more accurately than before. The mask is easy to use and provides a clear indication of when the telescope is in focus. I highly recommend using a Bahtinov mask for anyone who is serious about astrophotography.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-bahtinov-mask-">What is a Bahtinov mask ?

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Bahtinov mask is a focusing aid for astronomy in general, and astrophotography in particular. It consists of a disk with three sets of slits, each set at a different angle. The mask is placed over the front of the telescope, and the telescope is pointed at a bright star. The star&amp;rsquo;s light passes through the slits and creates diffraction spikes. When the telescope is out of focus, the spikes are not symmetrical. When the telescope is in focus, the spikes are symmetrical. The mask is named after its inventor, Russian amateur astrophotographer Pavel Bahtinov.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this video you can see how the diffraction spikes move when focusing the telescope. The goal is to get the middle spike in the middle of the other two spikes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Messier 81 and Messier 82 are two galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major. They are located at a distance of 12 million light years from Earth. M81 is a grand design spiral galaxy and M82 is an irregular galaxy. M81 has an apparent magnitude of 6.9 and M82 has an apparent magnitude of 8.4. M81 is about 90,000 light years across and M82 is about 37,000 light years across. M81 and M82 are interacting with each other, M82 is distorting M81&amp;rsquo;s spiral arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M82 got this shape because of the gravitational interaction with M81. The gravitational forces between the two galaxies are pulling the stars and gas in M82 towards M81. This is causing the gas in M82 to be compressed and heated up. This is causing the gas to emit a lot of light in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. This is why M82 is a starburst galaxy.&lt;/p>

This low budget allows me to learn a lot more and do some DIY customizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="original-mount">Original mount
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The base scope is an old Paralux 114/900 scope, it is a Newtonian reflector with a 114mm aperture and 900mm focal length. The original mount was a wooden equatorial mount with a clock drive. This setup is 40 years old since it was my father&amp;rsquo;s scope when he was a kid.&lt;/p>

data-flex-grow="133"
data-flex-basis="320px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main problem with this mount was the fact I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use a DSLR camera with it. The scope would not focus on the camera sensor. I started to take pictures using my phone and a phone adapter. The results were not great but it was a start.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="primary-mirror-upgrade">Primary mirror upgrade
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To achieve the focus with a DSLR camera I had to move the primary mirror up the tube. But first let&amp;rsquo;s see how a newtonian scope works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/current-rig/newtonian.jpg"

height="478"
loading="lazy"
alt="Schema of a newtonian telescope"
class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="251"
data-flex-basis="604px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The principle is simple, the light enters the tube and is reflected by the primary mirror to the secondary mirror. The secondary mirror reflects the light to the eyepiece. The eyepiece is placed at the focal point of the primary mirror. The distance between the primary mirror and the eyepiece is the focal length of the scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This type of scope have been invented by Isaac Newton in 1668. The main advantage of this design is the fact that the light is reflected only once. This means that the light is not absorbed by the tube walls. This is why this type of scope is very good for deep sky objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adding a DSLR to the setup means that the camera sensor has to be at the focal point of the primary mirror. Camera sensors are at the back of the camera body. This means that the primary mirror has to be moved up the tube to bring back the focus point on the camera sensor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option was to use a Barlow lens to increase the focal length of the scope. This would have allowed me to use the camera without moving the primary mirror. But this would have increased the focal length of the scope to 1800mm. This would have made the scope less versatile and would have required a more precise tracking. It would also have lower the field of view of the camera and the light gathering power of the scope which is not ideal for deep sky objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move the primary mirror I had to self design a custom piece using Blender. After a few iterations I came up with a design that would allow me to move the primary mirror up the tube by roughly 6 centimeters. This would allow me to focus on the camera sensor.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="new-goto-mount">New Goto mount
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The next step was to upgrade the mount. The old mount was not very stable and the clock drive was not very precise. I tried multiple times to find Messier 51 but never managed to get it, living in a bortle 6-7 zone doesn&amp;rsquo;t help either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I managed to get a second hand Celestron cg-5 goto mount- for 400 euros which is a great deal ! This mount is a lot more stable and precise. It also has a goto system that allows me to find objects in the sky. This is a game changer for me since I can now find objects in the sky without having to spend hours looking for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goto systems works by aligning the mount with the sky. The mount has to be aligned with 3 stars. The mount then knows where it is pointing in the sky. The mount can then move to any object in the sky. This is very useful for deep sky objects since they are very hard to find.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The next step is to get more experience with the mount and especially a betterpolar alignement. Right now star trails don&amp;rsquo;t let me go further than 15&amp;quot;, I will have to improve this to get longer exposures. I also plan to get a guiding scope in the future to get even longer exposures up to 300&amp;quot; which seems to be the sweet spot for deep sky objects. Guiding scopes are used to correct the mount tracking in real time by locking a star in the field. This is very useful for long exposures since the mount is not perfect and will drift over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orion nebulae - 10-04-2024</title><link>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/orion-nebulae-10-04-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:19:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/orion-nebulae-10-04-2024/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/orion-nebulae-10-04-2024/orion.PNG" alt="Featured image of post Orion nebulae - 10-04-2024" />&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://astro.thomas-mauran.com/p/orion-nebulae-10-04-2024/orion.PNG"

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The Orion nebulae is a diffuse nebulae situated in the Milky Way, being south of Orion&amp;rsquo;s Belt in the constellation of Orion. It is one of the brightest nebulae, and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. M42 is located at a distance of 1,344 ± 20 light years and is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. The M42 nebulae is estimated to be 24 light years across. It has a mass of about 2000 times the mass of the Sun. Older texts frequently refer to the Orion Nebula as the Great Nebula in Orion or the Great Orion Nebula.&lt;/p>
